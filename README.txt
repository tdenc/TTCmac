# TTCmac
A simple macOS app to import price table from Tamriel Trade Centre.
Now you can refer to TTC price within the mac client!

# Requirements
This is a stand-alone app, not an in-game Addon.
Of course you need Tamriel Trade Centre Addon to show TTC price data within the game.

# Installation
Unzip TTCmac.zip to wherever you like.

# Usage
1. Open the TTCmac folder and double-click TTCmac.app.
2. Select your server. For the first time you have to allow access to "Documents" folder.
3. Launch ESO and enjoy trading in Tamriel :)

Do this daily.
It is a good idea to register TTCmac.app to the Dock so as to activate app with one click!

# Todo
Uploading SavedVariables.
